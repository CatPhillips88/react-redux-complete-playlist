<!--Things to note when using react:

    * class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
    * should use className when naming a div tag
 -->

<!--To change the state of dynamic content of the example below:
    * state has been defined within the component as an JS object with property values
    * we use the component to output the template by the use of the 'this' keyword
    * along with the state and the object property name to
    * print to the browser 
-->

<!--To create a function within the component:
    * declare the function by name only before the render output along with any parameters
    * to call and output the function use the 'this' keyword with dot notation of the function name declaration
     i.e. handleClick(e) = this.handleMouse
    * this is particulary useful when we want to use an DOM event using
    * using event listener properties like onClick and onMouseOver
-->

<!-- * The 'this' keyword inside a function is determined by where the function is called not by
     * where the function sits.
     * The example below in handleClick function, when trying to call the function in relation
     * to the DOM event onClick, the console will print undefined value
     * The only approach around this is by using arrow functions,
     * as it takes the value of the 'this' keyword and passes it through the function.
-->  

<!-- * If we want to change the state and its object property values for instance like the example below
     * we use the setState() function then reassign the property values within
     * which should re-render with an updated state.
     * The example below should now print to the browser once the button is clicked.
